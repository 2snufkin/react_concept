What is the purpose of the component?
What data does the component need to receive as input?
How should the data be structured and formatted?
Are there any dependencies or external libraries that the component needs to use?
What should the component render to the screen?
How should the rendered output be structured and formatted?
What are the component's default or initial values?
How should the component handle user interactions, such as clicks or input changes?
Are there any special considerations or edge cases that need to be handled?
How should the component behave in response to changes in its input data or state?
How should the component be tested, and what are the expected results of each test?
How should the component be documented, including its purpose, inputs, outputs, and usage examples?

Sure, here are some additional questions you can add to your waterproof helping document:

Regarding state:

What data does the component need to store internally as state?
How should the state be initialized, and how should it change over time?
Are there any derived state values that should be computed from the existing state?
How should the state be updated in response to user interactions or changes in the input data?
Should the component use local state or rely on state management tools such as Redux?

Regarding communication with other components:

Does the component need to communicate with other components in the same hierarchy or with parent components?
What data or functions need to be passed down to child components as props?
How should the component handle changes in props passed down from parent components?
Does the component need to send data or trigger events to parent components?
How should the component handle events triggered by sibling components?

if parent compoenent


What data does the parent component need to pass down to the child component as props?
How should the parent component handle changes in data that it passes down to the child component?
Should the parent component handle any events triggered by the child component? If so, how should it respond?
How should the parent component handle updates to its own state that may affect the child component?
Are there any performance considerations related to passing data down from the parent component to the child component? If so, how should these be addressed?
Should the parent component be responsible for managing the state of the child component, or should the child component manage its own state?
How should the parent component handle rendering the child component, and when should the child component be re-rendered?
How should the parent component handle events or data received from the child component?
Should the parent component store any of the child component's data in its own state?
How should the parent component handle rendering the child component, and what props should it pass to the child component during rendering?
Is there a need for the parent component to trigger a re-render of the child component?
Should the parent component be responsible for any of the child component's behavior, such as validation or data formatting?
Should the parent component be able to access or modify the child component's state directly, or should all interaction be via props and events?

if child component
What data does the child component need to receive from the parent component as props?
How should the child component handle changes to the props it receives from the parent component?
How should the child component handle events or data that need to be sent back to the parent component?
Should the child component store any of its own state, or should all data be passed down from the parent component?
How should the child component handle rendering its own content, and what props or state should it use during rendering?
Is there a need for the child component to trigger a re-render of the parent component?
Should the child component be responsible for any of its own behavior, such as validation or data formatting?
Should the child component be able to access or modify its parent component's state directly, or should all interaction be via props and events?
